# LazyBroadcast.jl

We believe that software should be

 - simple
 - unit tested
 - fast
 - granular

LazyBroadcast.jl helps us achieve via [`lazy_broadcast`](https://clima.github.io/LazyBroadcast.jl/dev/api/#LazyBroadcast.lazy_broadcast).
See our [documentation](https://clima.github.io/LazyBroadcast.jl/dev/) for a
more in-depth dive into how it works.
