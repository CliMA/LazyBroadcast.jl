# LazyBroadcast.jl

## Purpose

We believe that software should be

 - simple
 - unit tested
 - fast
 - granular

LazyBroadcast.jl helps us achieve via [`lazy_broadcast`](@ref LazyBroadcast.lazy_broadcast).
`lazy_broadcast` can help you write more expressive code, and speed up your
applications by fusing operations and eliminating intermediate allocations.

To try this out, see our [quick-start](https://clima.github.io/LazyBroadcast.jl/dev/quick_start/).
